1. Click the **DB Console** tab within the tutorial. The DB Console will open in a new browser tab.
1. In the DB Console, select **Network Latency**.
1. Notice that within a single region, round-trip latency is under 6 ms (milliseconds). Across regions, round-trip latency is significantly higher.
1. Click **Continue**.
